Expensive operations on main show as "Not responding" on the Windows top bar

## To test

`npm install`

`npm start`

Press the "Expensive" button to start an expensive function in Main

The counter serves the purpose of visualizing that the app's renderer is working fine.

I use a fibonacci function of 48 in order to fake an expensive operation and make sure that the "Not responding" warning fires.
